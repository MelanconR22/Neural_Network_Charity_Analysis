# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

AlphabetSoup is a philantrhopic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that help the environment, improve people's well-being, and unify the world.  AlphabetSoup has raised and donated over 10 billion dollars over the last 20 years.  I have been asked to study the impact that donations provide and to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which organizations are too high risk.  To perform this task, I will design and train a deep learning neural network to evaluate data to produce a clear decision making result.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
##### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

##### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

##### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
##### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
##### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
##### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
